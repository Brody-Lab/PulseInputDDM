# pulse input DDM

This is a package for inferring the parameters of drift diffusion models (DDMs) from neural activity or behavioral data collected when a subject is performing a pulse-based evidence accumlation task.

## Getting Started

To install the package see [Getting started](@ref).

## Fitting models

The basic functions you need to optimize the model parameters for choice data are described in [Fitting the model to choices](@ref). 
If you want to optimize the model parameters for neural data, look here [Fitting the  model to neural activity](@ref).
