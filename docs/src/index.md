# pulse input DDM

This is a package for inferring the parameters of drift diffusion models (DDMs) using gradient descent from neural activity or behavioral data collected when a subject is performing a pulse-based input evidence accumlation task.

## Getting Started

If you want to fit the model to some data but want to interact with Julia, I recommend using a Jupyter notebook and scotty. This is somewhat involved to set up but worth the time. Here are the necessary steps.
