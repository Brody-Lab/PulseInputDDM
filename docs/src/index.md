# pulse input DDM

This is a package for inferring the parameters of drift diffusion models (DDMs) from neural activity or behavioral data collected when a subject is performing a pulse-based evidence accumulation task.

## Getting Started

To install the package see [Downloading the package](@ref). Brian test. Test again. 

## Fitting models

The basic functions you need to optimize the model parameters for choice data are described in [Loading data and fitting a choice model](@ref). You can see an example fit to synthetic data here: [Fitting a choice model](@ref).
