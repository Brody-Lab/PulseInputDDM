# Working interactively on scotty via a SSH tunnel

You should be all set up to create a SSH tunnel to scotty (if not check out the section [Preliminaries to fitting the model interactively on scotty](@ref)). Follow the steps in the section [Now that everything's set up, how do I open a notebook _again_?](@ref) to create a new SSH tunnel and launch a new jupyter notebook server.

## Running the model using a notebook

OK, we're ready to analyze some data! Open a new notebook and call it whatever you like and save it whereever you like.

`load_and_optimize(path,sessids,ratnames)`.
