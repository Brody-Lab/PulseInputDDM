# Introduction

Julia code for inferring a latent drift diffusion model (DDM) model from data during pulsed-based evidence accumlation tasks.

# Getting started

First, you need Julia 1.0. Then you need to add this package by typing `Pkg.clone(https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/pulse_input_DDM.jl/`.

# Useful functions

Most users will want to work with these functions: 

* `poiss_LL`: compute the Poisson log likelihood
