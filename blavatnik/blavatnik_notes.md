**Given the human brain's 100 billion nerve cells (or neurons), its complexity belies a simple answer to this question.**

**Intuitively,  when one decides between a small number of options, only a small number of “variables” should need to be encoded in one's brain.**

**Yet we have a huge number of neurons in our brain and modern experimental methods allow us to record from a substantial fraction of them. Can we use these neural observations to posit and identify a more parsimonious model of the decision making process consistent with our above intuition? **

**observing both the choices rats make when faced with a decision, as well as the concurrent neural activity while they make that decision. How is decision making mediated by the activity of a group of neurons?**

**that a large number of complex observations can be described by a small number of ``latent'' or unseen variables**

**My research focuses on building mathematical models to describe and understand brain activity observed in behaving animals. **

**Artificial last in conclusions**

**Impact brody lab lots of data, different types, different brain regions**

**Sensory systems, but what are internal states, frontier**

**But need some external variate to tie it to**

**Scalable methods for understanding this data**

**Internal state, integrate new evidence with previous belief. **

**Evidence accumulation task.Working memory.**

**Combine data from multiple animals.**

**Want to infer this interval variables from observations. How forgetful is the animal?**

**Quality: The extent to which the work is reliable, valid, credible, and scientifically rigorous.**

**Impact: The extent to which the work addresses an important problem and is influential in the nominee’s field.**

**Novelty: The extent to which the work challenges existing paradigms, employs new methodologies or concepts, and/or pursues an original question.**

**Promise: Nominee’s potential for an independent career and further significant contributions to science or science-related fields. **

**Key results, their impact on the nominee’s field of study, and the nominee’s specific role in the described work should be included.**

lambda from neurons is very large and positive. lambda from choices is stable. Indicates that integration is done elsewhere. (Hanks et al. 2015) **
